# Introduction
Welcome! this playground is about an Indonesian traditional hand game, which can be played without any tools, only your hands!
 
 This hand game usually played by kids (sometimes adults!) while waiting for a bus, or deciding who gets to do something first because its quick, easy to play, and quite tensing!

* Callout(How to play):
    * You and your opponent (in this case, computer) will take turns.
    * In each round, you can choose to raise your thumbs or not to raise.
    * Try to guess the number of raised thumbs correctly, and hope your opponent guess incorrectly.
    * For each correct guess, you can put one of your hand down, which makes maximum possible thumbs up reduced by one.
    * Whoever guess the correct thumbs up twice win.

 Note: Turn off "Enable results" then click "Run my code" to start playing!
 
 Thanks for reading and playing!
